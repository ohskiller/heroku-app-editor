# Web form to create a minimal Python-Flask application
This app is for experimenting with the minimal Python-Flask setup. It allows the user to deploy a new app consisting of three files only:
* Procfile
* requirements.txt
* run.py

It includes Javascript for a simple loading screen, and pipes build output from the [Heroku Platform API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-and-release-using-the-api#build-output) to the browser.

See it working [here](https://min-rdm.herokuapp.com). Or you can...
